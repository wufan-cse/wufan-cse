<p>Thanks for stopping by!</p>

<p>**Research: **
My interest lies in practical machine learning methods and their theoretical analysis, spanning multiple areas such as Out-of-Distribution Generalization, Trustworthy Machine Learning, and Generative models. 
Specifically, I am interested in developing methods that enhance the capacity of learning predictive representations. 
Moreover, I strongly believe that the potential of large deep learning models is yet to be fully explored.
My ultimate goal is to create a unified, robust, and generalizable machine learning method that is cost-efficient and accessible to everyone.</p>

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too.
