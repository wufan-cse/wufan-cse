<strong>Research:</strong>
My interest lies in practical machine learning methods and their theoretical analysis, spanning multiple areas such as Out-of-Distribution Generalization, Trustworthy Machine Learning, and Generative models. Specifically, I am interested in developing methods that enhance the capacity of learning predictive representations. Moreover, I strongly believe that the potential of large deep learning models is yet to be fully explored. My ultimate goal is to create a unified, robust, and generalizable machine learning method that is cost-efficient and accessible to everyone.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
